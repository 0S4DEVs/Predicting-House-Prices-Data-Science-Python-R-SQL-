# Predicting-House-Prices-Data-Science-Python-R-SQL-
This project aims to predict the prices of houses based on various features of the houses such as the number of bedrooms, the area of the house, etc. The dataset used for this project is the Boston Housing dataset which contains information about various houses in the Boston area.

Getting Started
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
You will also need to have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the project.

Data
The Boston Housing dataset contains the following features:

CRIM: Per capita crime rate by town
ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
INDUS: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM: Average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
RAD: Index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX: Full-value property tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio by town
B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
LSTAT: % lower status of the population
MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
The target variable that we will be predicting is the MEDV column which contains the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.

Project Structure
predicting_house_prices.ipynb - a Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project
housing.csv - the dataset used for the project

Running the Project
To run the project, open the predicting_house_prices.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell in order. The notebook contains detailed explanations of the code and the steps involved in the project.

Conclusion
In this project, we used the Boston Housing dataset to predict the prices of houses based on various features of the houses. We first explored the dataset and performed some data cleaning and preprocessing. We then trained and evaluated several machine learning models and selected the best one based on its performance. Finally, we used the best model to make predictions on new data.
